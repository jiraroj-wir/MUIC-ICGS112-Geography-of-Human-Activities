## Explain the concept of optimum population and discuss how the Neo-Malthusian and Boserup theories apply to the challenges of underpopulation and overpopulation. Analyze how these theories can be implemented to address population issues in different regions, considering factors such as economic development, resource availability, and technological advancement.

- Neo-Malthusian: warns of overpopulation, resource depletion → supports birth control.

- Boserup: population pressure drives innovation in agriculture.

- Underpopulation: missed economic opportunities.

- Apply theories to real cases (e.g., Africa for Boserup, Japan for Malthusian).

- Suggest policies like education, tech investment, migration incentives.

## Explain the proposals made by the Club of Rome conference and discuss how a decline in the global population could impact industrial sectors, consumer behavior, and product markets. Consider both the challenges and opportunities this demographic shift could create for economies worldwide.

## Reflect on the five migration theories: Neoclassical Economic Theory, Dual Labor Market Theory, New Economics of Labor Migration Theory, Relative Deprivation Theory, and World Economic System Theory. Compare and contrast their explanations for migration patterns, focusing on the economic, social, and political factors that influence individual and group migration decisions.
