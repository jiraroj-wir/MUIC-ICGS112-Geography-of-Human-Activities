## Which theory of human behavior is most effective and why?

**Answer:**

Choose one of these theories and explain:

- Initial investment is high, but total cost drops over years.

---

## Why can’t machines replace all labor?

**Answer:**

- Some jobs (e.g., chef, artist) require human creativity and judgment.

- Machine breakdowns and upgrades are costly.

- Limited applicability in sectors needing emotional intelligence or taste.

---

## Why is encouraging population growth a complex strategy?

**Answer:**

- Time lag: 18–20 years before results.

- Needs stable funding, trust in government.

- Must compete with short-term solutions while planning long-term.

---

## How should governments balance foreign and local labor solutions?

**Answer:**

- Discuss pros and cons of each:

- Local labor keeps money internal, builds stable workforce.

- Foreign labor fills immediate gaps but risks conflict.

- Ideal: Use a combination, with gradual shift toward self-sufficiency.

---

## Why is it that developed countries may experience labor shortage in the near future?

**Answer:**

- Low birth rates → fewer new workers entering the labor force

- Aging population → larger share of retirees

- High economic demands remain, while local labor supply shrinks

---

## How to overcome labor shortage?

**Answer:**

- Solution 1: Allow foreign migrants

- Pros: quick, cheap, immediate labor

- Cons: crime, cultural disruption, leakage of money, political tension, wage suppression

- Solution 2: Use machines

- Pros: long-term cost efficiency, continuous operation

- Cons: high initial cost, not suitable for all tasks, need specialists, maintenance delays

- Solution 3: Encourage citizens to give birth

- Pros: national self-sufficiency, sustainable

- Cons: long waiting time (18+ years), high government spending required, needs trustworthy policy

## Government vs. Religious sector – which is better at controlling birth/death rate?

**Answer:**

- Government:

- Easier to control death rate (e.g. through vaccination, war restrictions)

- Difficult to control birth rate due to cultural/religious resistance

- Religious sector:

- Believes death is God’s will, hard to control

- Easier to influence birth rate by aligning teachings with God's will (e.g. birth = merit)

---

## What causes decrease in death rate (4 factors)?

**Answer:**

- Increase in food supply and production efficiency

- Better nutrition → stronger immune system

- Modern and multiple cropping systems

- Invention of silo and freezing systems for better storage and transportation

---

## What happens when death rate declines?

**Answer:**

- People live longer → more time to find partner and have children

- Surviving population + newborns = increased population

- May lead to population density increase

---

## What might happen after a lot of people die in one period?

**Answer:**

- Birth rate increases in future to replace the dead

- Labor demand rises

- People want children to help with resources and work

---

## If you're the government or a religious leader, how do you think about birth/death rate?

**Answer:**

- Government:

- Can regulate death rate more easily (policy-driven, people fear death)

- Cannot easily regulate birth rate due to culture, religion

- Religion:

- Believes death is in God’s hands, not controllable

- Can influence birth rate easily through divine teachings

---

## What is the answer to question number three?

**Answer:**

- The first factor that caused the decline in birth rate is the falling rate of infant mortality due to improved sanitation and medication.

- Parents no longer need to have extra babies to compensate for child mortality.

- Economic self-interest: children are expensive and limit lifestyle quality.

- Urbanization and liberalization led to more education and rights awareness, especially among women.

- Women gained autonomy over reproductive decisions.

- Increased access to birth control, safe abortion, and family planning information in developed countries.

- Shifts in traditional gender roles and doubt about family structure contributed to lower birth rates.

## What is the difference between literacy rate and education rate?

**Answer:**

- Literacy rate = ability to read and write, but not necessarily understand content.

- Education rate = ability to comprehend, apply, and extend knowledge.

- Education involves real-world problem solving and analysis.

- Most countries report only literacy rate because measuring education rate is complex and qualitative.
