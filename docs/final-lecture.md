## Factory Location Decision-Making

### Two Core Priorities

- **Access to transportation**
  - Necessary for receiving **raw materials** and delivering **finished goods**.
- **Access to energy sources**
  - Supports **productivity** and **efficiency** (e.g., electricity, manpower, solar, wind).

---

### Locational Decision Factors

These are additional, non-essential considerations that help improve profitability and factory success.

#### Labor Supply
- More available labor → lower wages.
- Areas with large labor pools are attractive due to lower production costs.
- Examples: China, India.

#### Availability of Raw Materials
- Factories near raw material sources can lower transport costs.
- Producers may offer lower prices due to convenience and competition.
- Example: A pineapple factory near pineapple farms saves transport costs.

#### Cost of Living
- Lower cost of living → cheaper utilities (electricity, water), insurance, and services.
- Reduces total production expenses.
- Developed countries have higher insurance and benefit costs.

#### Weak Human Rights Protections
- In areas with fewer worker rights:
  - Longer work hours allowed
  - Lower wages
  - Fewer legal obligations for employers
- More cost-effective (but ethically questionable) business environment.

---

## Types of Labor

### Skilled Labor
- Found in cities or developed countries.
- Highly educated with specialized training.
- Required for complex products: weapons, aircraft, MRI machines.

### Unskilled Labor
- Found in rural or less developed regions.
- Manual work, minimal training.
- Used for mass production of basic goods: food, clothing.

## Product Placement and Labor Strategy

| Product Type         | Labor Type        | Factory Location        | Notes                                   |
|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Daily/Cheap Goods     | Unskilled          | Close to consumers       | Save on transport; low-cost production  |
| Technological Goods   | Skilled            | Developed countries      | Accepted high price covers expenses     |
| Market Products       | = Cheap Products   | Same as above            | Low quality, labor-intensive            |
| Advanced Products     | = Tech Products    | Same as above            | High value, capital-intensive           |

---

## New Locational Trend (Post-1970)

### Changes in Developed Countries

#### Labor Law Improvements
- Labor unions influenced governments to:
  - Mandate maternity leave
  - Define working hours and overtime pay
  - Require insurance and wellness provisions
- Increased employer responsibility and investment costs

#### Environmental Law Improvements
- Regulated waste, air pollution, factory zoning
- Required wastewater treatment, air filtration
- Introduced carbon emission audits and CSR (corporate social responsibility) duties
- Example: Toyota pays for trees planted in developing countries

#### Cost of Living and Wages
- Post-WWII, living costs and wages rose in developed countries
- Operating businesses became more expensive

#### Trade Barriers
- Increase in customs taxes and tariffs
- Rising gasoline costs impacted shipping and logistics

---

### Advantages of Less Developed Countries

#### Labor Conditions
- Weak or no unions
- Lack of labor protections
- No minimum wage laws in many cases

#### Environmental Regulations
- Few or unenforced
- High corruption allows pollution in exchange for bribes

#### Cost Efficiency
- Cheap labor and utilities
- Minimal compliance costs

#### Taxation and Trade
- Low or negotiable import/export taxes
- Corruption enables avoidance of official charges

#### Resource Proximity
- Many raw materials are sourced locally
- Reduces import dependence and costs

---

## Shift Toward Fair Trade (Post-2000)

- Rise of **fair trade** movements emphasized ethical production
- Producers in less developed countries faced pressure to improve labor and environmental practices
- Some factories moved back to developed countries

### New Strategy: Marketing Over Relocation

- Companies used advertising to justify higher prices
- Enhanced product image through packaging, branding, and storytelling
- Consumers accepted increased prices for perceived quality or innovation

Example:
- Sunsilk shampoo once produced cheaply in Southeast Asia now costs more due to brand repositioning and marketing despite similar ingredients.

---

## Multinational Corporations (MNCs) and Raw Materials

- MNCs like Unilever are owned and operated by people from different countries (e.g., British, Swiss).
- These companies have **large capital** and often **produce their own raw materials**, reducing reliance on small or poor farmers in less developed countries.
- Before, small farmers sold raw materials to MNCs, but now MNCs:
  - Rent land in less developed countries
  - Hire local labor to produce materials under their control
- By producing their own raw materials, MNCs:
  - Control quality and quantity of production
  - Stabilize production cost
  - Sell excess materials to other companies
- This reinforces inequality: **rich corporations benefit**, while **small producers lose market access and income**

---

## Country Classification: Industrial vs. Agricultural

Countries are classified along different axes:
1. Developed vs. Less Developed
2. Rich vs. Poor → Based on **GNP**
3. Industrial vs. Agricultural → Based on 4 criteria

### Criteria for Industrial vs. Agricultural Country

1. **Amount of Productivity by Sector**
   - Compare total output from industrial and agricultural sectors.

2. **Value of Productivity**
   - Compare **economic value** of outputs (e.g., 100 tons of crops might be worth more than 500 tons of industrial goods).

3. **Ownership of Investment**
   - If foreign investors produce most goods, wealth does **not stay** in the country.
   - Local production = better indicator of being an industrial/agricultural country.

4. **Technology Ownership**
   - If the country uses its own technology → production and output **belong to them**.
   - Foreign tech = dependence, even if production is high.

> You must analyze all 4 criteria to properly define a country’s industrial/agricultural status.

#### Example:
- Country B:
  - Produces 50 tons industrial, high value
  - But production and tech are foreign-owned
  - → **Not** an industrial country despite high output

#### Thailand Case:
- Equal share of local and foreign investors
- Still produces more agricultural than industrial goods
- Therefore, Thailand is **semi-industrial and agricultural**

---

## Trade Barriers

### Background
- Pre-1960s: Cheap products flowed freely across borders
- Hurt local industries in US, China, and others
- Created dependency on foreign imports

### Trade Barrier Strategies

1. **Increased Customs Tax**
   - Raises cost of imports to protect local businesses
   - Example: Luxury goods like Chanel bags or Ferrari become expensive in Thailand due to 300–400% customs tax

2. **Quota**
   - Limits quantity of foreign goods entering the country
   - Example: If Nike can only send 2,000 pairs of shoes instead of 1 million, they must raise prices to keep profit
   - → Makes imported products less attractive, encourages local consumption

> Goal: Prevent economic dependency and **leakage of money** from the national economy

---

## Critique of Worker-Based Country Classification

Some geographers suggest classifying countries based on number of workers in each sector, but this is inaccurate.

### Why Counting Workers Is Misleading

1. **Migrant Workers**
   - Money sent home creates economic leakage
   - Hard to measure actual income retained in host country

2. **Technology Replaces Labor**
   - Machines produce more with fewer workers
   - Example: 1 machine might output 10 tons/day vs. 1.5 tons/day by a human

3. **Invisible Labor**
   - Illegal workers and child laborers are not counted officially
   - Significant portion of workforce is hidden
   - Machines are also a form of "hidden labor"

> Worker count **alone** does not reflect actual dependency on a sector

---

## Economic Indicators: GNP vs. GDP

### Gross National Product (GNP)
- Total income **earned by a country’s citizens**, regardless of where they are in the world
- Includes income from:
  - Thai investors/businesses abroad
  - Migrant Thai workers overseas

#### Pros:
- Reflects how much nationals earn globally

#### Cons:
- In **less developed countries**, GNP is **inaccurate**:
  - Many don’t report income or pay taxes
  - Hidden/unregistered income not counted
- High GNP doesn’t mean wealth is equally distributed
  - Example: Oil-rich countries (e.g., Middle East) have high GNP but large inequality
  - Many live under $2/day

> GNP = Indicator of national income, **not** quality of life or development

---

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Measures **total value of production within the country**, regardless of who owns it

#### Characteristics:
- Calculated from products **made in national territory**
- Includes foreign-owned businesses

#### Issues:
- GDP increase ≠ public benefit
- Politicians use GDP growth to **claim success**, even if citizens aren’t thriving
- Much of GDP can come from **foreign investment**, profits may not stay in the country
- Migrant workers in-country also cause economic leakage

> GDP shows economic **size**, but not necessarily **well-being** or **equality**

---

## Tertiary Economic Activity

- Sector based on **services and specialized skills**
- Examples:
  - Accounting
  - Medicine
  - Legal services
  - Labor-based services (even prostitution mentioned as a skill-for-hire)

> In this sector, people **sell their knowledge or skills** rather than goods

---

## Transmigration in Indonesia

### Background
- Java Island (capital: Jakarta) is overcrowded due to industrial development and job opportunities.
- Internal migration from other islands caused:
  - High unemployment
  - Slums
  - Poor sanitation and health
- Government’s solution: **Transmigration Project**
  - Encourage people to move from Java to other "empty" islands.

### Goals of the Program
- Reduce pressure on Java’s infrastructure and social services.
- Develop underused land and increase **agricultural productivity**.
- Improve economic output and national development.

---

### Implementation Strategy
- Volunteers were promised:
  - **Land ownership** on new islands.
  - **Financial aid** (~$3,000–$6,000/family).
- Indonesia took a **loan from IMF** to fund the project.

---

## Issues and Failures

### 1. Land Conflict
- Many islands already inhabited by **tribal groups** who weren’t recognized by the government.
- Land ownership conflicts arose:
  - Tribal people: ancestral claims
  - Migrants: legal documents issued by the government
- Government failed to resolve this dispute.

### 2. Religious Conflict
- Newcomers: predominantly **Muslim**
- Tribal people: mostly **Christian** or **Animist**
- Resulted in **religious violence**, including:
  - Attacks on mosques and churches
  - Ongoing tensions and distrust

### 3. Lack of Agricultural Skills
- Migrants lacked knowledge and tools for farming.
- Poor productivity due to:
  - No training
  - No agricultural equipment
- Migrants attempted to increase output by **expanding plantations** (illegally).

### 4. Environmental Degradation
- Expansion led to:
  - **Deforestation**
  - **Soil erosion**
  - **Landslides**
  - Disruption of **local ecosystems**

### 5. Lack of Infrastructure
- No roads, electricity, water systems on the new islands.
- Migrants had to spend money on basic infrastructure.
- This limited their ability to invest in farming or build homes.

---

### Long-Term Outcome
- Many migrants **gave up** and returned to Java Island.
- Social issues in Java **returned**, now **with added IMF debt**.
- Failure attributed to:
  - Poor planning
  - No pre-built infrastructure
  - Ignoring local communities
  - Cultural and environmental neglect

---

## Concept: Optimum Population

### Definition
- Ideal balance between population size and available resources in an area.

### Scenarios
- **Overpopulation**: too many people for the available resources.
- **Underpopulation**: too few people to fully utilize available resources.

---

## Overpopulation

### Common Issues
- Unemployment
- Poverty
- Resource scarcity
- Decline in living standards

### Theories

#### Malthusian Theory
- Population grows faster than food production.
- Result: famine, disease, death → population decline
- Solution: **do nothing**, nature will balance it.

> Criticism: ignores role of **technology** in increasing productivity.

#### Boserup’s Theory
- Population growth pushes **agriculture to improve**.
- Farmers feel pressured to produce more.
- Stimulates **technological advancement**.

> Criticism: assumes people **cannot migrate**, only applies to isolated communities.

---

## Underpopulation

### Characteristics
- More resources than people
- Often occurs in **resource-rich** but **sparsely populated** countries

### Outcomes
- Attracts:
  - **Investors** (to exploit unused resources)
  - **Skilled labor** (to work for investors)
- Leads to:
  - Increased population
  - Growth in GDP/GNP
  - External dependency if locals lack control

---

## Club of Rome (1972)

- International conference on population, environment, and sustainability.
- Participants: mostly Europeans from science, politics, and economics.

### Key Arguments
- World is consuming **resources too fast**
- Suggested global **birth control policies** to manage population

> Hypocrisy: Europeans pushed control policies on **less developed countries**, but refused to apply it to themselves due to religious reasons (Christianity).

---

### Feminist Critique
- Western feminists promoted **birth control** to reduce domestic burden and improve women's freedom.
- Suggested:
  - Fewer children → less work → more time for self-development
- Criticized by women in less developed countries who:
  - Relied on religion/culture for identity and survival
  - Found Western feminism to be out-of-touch and condescending

---

## Theory: Pop Growth & Industrial Decline (Post-Club of Rome)

### Predictions
- Population decline → fewer consumers
- Industry will shrink → mass unemployment
- Companies will:
  - Use **more technology**, fewer workers
  - Stop innovating (no demand = no need to improve)

> Criticism: Technological development may continue due to **human desire**, not just economic necessity

---

## Introduction to Urban Geography

### What Is a City?

- A city is defined as a **permanent human settlement** with:
  - High population density
  - Complex infrastructure
  - Diverse activities (economic, political, cultural)
- Differentiated from rural areas by:
  - Economic diversity (not limited to agriculture)
  - Administrative functions
  - Technological infrastructure
  - Cultural significance

---

## Push and Pull Factors of Urbanization

### Push Factors (from rural areas)
- Lack of education
- Lack of employment
- Poor infrastructure and services
- Land scarcity or poor farming conditions

### Pull Factors (to cities)
- Job opportunities (especially in industrial and service sectors)
- Better education
- Healthcare access
- Lifestyle attractions

---

## Problems of Rapid Urbanization

### Economic Problems
- High cost of living
- Inequality and poverty in urban slums
- Informal labor market (unstable employment)

### Infrastructure Problems
- Traffic congestion
- Pollution (air, water, noise)
- Waste management issues
- Housing shortages

### Social Issues
- Overcrowding
- Crime and insecurity
- Lack of public spaces

> Poor urban planning leads to **chaotic development**, making these problems worse.

---

## Urban Land Use Patterns

### Central Business District (CBD)
- Commercial and financial center of the city
- High land value
- Tall buildings, offices, department stores
- Accessible via public transport

### Surrounding Zones
1. **Transitional Zone**
   - Mix of residential and industrial use
   - Often includes slums and older housing

2. **Residential Zone**
   - Middle and upper-class housing
   - Schools, hospitals, amenities

3. **Industrial Zone**
   - Factories, warehouses
   - Often located near railways, highways, or rivers

4. **Suburbs**
   - Low-density housing
   - Commuter areas
   - More space, better living conditions

> These zones are not fixed; urban sprawl and gentrification change them over time.

---

## Theories of Urban Structure

### 1. Concentric Zone Model (Burgess)
- City develops in circular rings:
  - Center: CBD
  - Surrounding rings: transition → working-class → middle-class → suburbs
- Based on American industrial cities

### 2. Sector Model (Hoyt)
- Development extends outward in **sectors** or wedges, not rings.
- Focuses on transportation corridors.
- High-income areas form along highways or waterfronts.

### 3. Multiple Nuclei Model
- City has **multiple centers** (nuclei) of activity
- Each nucleus specializes in a specific function (e.g., university, shopping, industry)
- Reflects decentralization and complexity of modern cities

> All models help explain different cities, but no single one fits all urban areas.

---

## Case Study: Bangkok

- Developed in a **linear pattern** along roads and railways.
- Lacks a strict central plan → irregular layout
- Mix of all urban models:
  - Concentric core (Rattanakosin)
  - Sector-like expansion along Sukhumvit and Silom
  - Nuclei (e.g., Ladprao, Rangsit, Bangna)

> Bangkok's sprawl and informal development cause major traffic and housing issues.

---

## Urban Planning

### Why Planning Matters
- Ensures efficient land use
- Reduces congestion and pollution
- Provides housing and public services
- Prevents slum formation

### Challenges in Developing Countries
- Lack of funding
- Weak governance and corruption
- Rapid population growth
- Land tenure issues (ownership disputes)

---

## Solutions and Innovations

### Smart Growth
- Urban development strategy that focuses on:
  - Public transport
  - Mixed-use neighborhoods
  - Preservation of green space

### Satellite Cities
- Smaller cities built around a major city to absorb population pressure
- Planned with their own infrastructure and services

### Slum Upgrading
- Improve conditions in informal settlements:
  - Provide utilities (water, electricity)
  - Improve roads and sanitation
  - Legalize land ownership

---

## Culture: Definitions and Core Concepts

### Norms
- **Definition**: Commonly accepted standards or rules within a society that dictate acceptable behavior.
- **Transmission**: Taught from birth—initially by parents, then reinforced by the community.
- **Relation to Law**:
  - Laws are often formed from widely accepted norms.
  - Example: In Islamic societies, harsh punishments like hand-cutting for theft originate from cultural norms.
- **Punishment**:
  - Legal punishments (e.g., imprisonment, fines).
  - Extra-legal or cultural punishments (e.g., gossip, ostracism, honor killings).
  - Some cultural punishments violate human rights (e.g., burning for adultery) but are justified by claims to "cultural rights".

### Patriarchal Culture
- Most current norms originate from male-dominated societies.
- Functions of norms:
  - Control behavior
  - Maintain peace/security
  - Support power structures

---

## Tradition, Custom, and Cultural Rights

### Tradition
- **Definition**: Symbolic beliefs and practices passed down through generations.
- **Purpose**: Maintains the continuity and strength of culture.
- **Example**: Wai gesture in Thailand reflects respect; Loi Krathong reflects gratitude to the water goddess.

### Custom
- **Definition**: Repeated behaviors done without questioning the reason.
- **Characteristics**: Least important; should be revised frequently.
- **Example**: Taking food photos before eating because others do.

### Cultural Rights
- **Government Perspective**:
  - Everyone should have equal access to enjoy and participate in cultural practices.
  - Duties: create laws, host events, protect participants.
- **Community Perspective**:
  - Cultural rights = right to **preserve** culture and **resist change**.
  - Maintain uniqueness and prevent external disturbance.
- **Conflict**:
  - Some practices violate national laws/human rights (e.g., rape culture used to justify acts).
  - Requires compromise between state, people, and human rights law.

---

## Cultural Identity & Heritage

### Cultural Identity
- Made up of:
  1. Unique beliefs and practices
  2. Tangible heritage (architecture, land, statues)

### Cultural Heritage
- Physical/tangible elements of culture.
- Includes buildings, landscapes, and monuments.

---

## Three Cultural Components

### 1. Artifacts
- **Definition**: Tangible and intangible items that reflect a culture.
- **Examples**: Food, language, stories, dance.
- **Features**:
  - Most visible and accessible part of culture.
  - Can easily change (e.g., evolution of Thai papaya salad "som tam").
  - Used to protect the core of culture (mentifacts).

### 2. Sociofacts
- **Definition**: Social structures and institutions that govern behavior.
- **Examples**:
  - Family (smallest unit, with roles/duties)
  - Government (protect rights, maintain order)
  - Education (ensure access to learning)
  - Healthcare (access to medical treatment)
  - Religion (spiritual/moral support)
- **Change**: Requires effort, planning, and possibly protest or revolution.

### 3. Mentifacts
- **Definition**: Abstract beliefs, values, ideologies, and perceptions.
- **Transmission**: Oral traditions, generational teaching.
- **Resistance to Change**:
  - Hardest part of culture to change.
  - Requires time, education, and evidence.
  - Example: Beliefs about natural phenomena like earthquakes once explained by myth.

---

## Interconnection of Cultural Components

- **Artifacts** can reveal:
  - **Sociofacts**: Through spatial arrangement, usage (e.g., house layout reveals family structure).
  - **Mentifacts**: Through decoration, architecture (e.g., Buddha statues reveal religious beliefs).

---

## Theories of Culture Formation

### 1. Environmental Determinism
- **Belief**: Culture is entirely shaped by nature.
- **Implications**:
  - Denies human free will.
  - Encourages blaming nature for personal actions (e.g., "I hit someone because it was hot").
- **Religion**: Aligns with Christianity’s concept of predestination (God has already determined everything).
- **Downside**: May encourage irresponsibility.

### 2. Positivism
- **Belief**: Culture comes from human knowledge, history, experience, science, and technology.
- **Benefits**:
  - Promotes logic, reason, and adaptation.
  - Culture evolves with society.
  - Fact-based and practical.
- **Downside**: No room for hope or spirituality—can feel emotionally empty.

### 3. Cultural Ecology
- **Belief**: Culture arises from a balance of nature and human knowledge.
- **Purpose**: Create a neutral, balanced culture combining fact and spirituality.
- **Outcome**: More inclusive and sustainable culture.
