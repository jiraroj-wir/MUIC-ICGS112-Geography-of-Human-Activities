  <h1>Exam Questions</h1>

<h2 id="which-theory-of-human-behavior-is-most-effective-and-why">Which theory of human behavior is most effective and why?</h2>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Choose one of these theories and explain:
- Behaviorism — focuses on external conditioning and stimulus-response patterns
- Constructivism — argues knowledge is shaped by individual experience and social context
- Cognitivism — emphasizes internal mental processes; different people process information differently
- Dialectical — combines opposing views (thesis and antithesis) into a synthesis for broader understanding</p>
<p>Use long-form reasoning and a relevant example.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="explain-the-development-of-geographical-study-throughout-history">Explain the development of geographical study throughout history</h2>

- Dark Ages — stagnation of geographical knowledge
- Renaissance — exploration, scientific methods
- Colonial — driven by exploitation and conquest
- Modern — focused on sustainability and technology (GIS, GPS)</p>
<p>Mention the purpose, tools, and societal context in each period.</p>

- Technological advances → new habitable zones (floating farms)
- Economic integration (ASEAN) → new migration, new markets, new housing</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-do-spatial-and-ecological-perspectives-define-value-differently">How do spatial and ecological perspectives define “value” differently?</h2>

<h2 id="government-vs-religious-sector-which-is-better-at-controlling-birthdeath-rate">Government vs. Religious sector – which is better at controlling birth/death rate?</h2>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
- Government:
  - Easier to control death rate (e.g. through vaccination, war restrictions)
  - Difficult to control birth rate due to cultural/religious resistance
- Religious sector:
  - Believes death is God’s will, hard to control

<hr />
<h2 id="what-happens-when-death-rate-declines">What happens when death rate declines?</h2>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
- People live longer → more time to find partner and have children
- Surviving population + newborns = increased population
- May lead to population density increase</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-might-happen-after-a-lot-of-people-die-in-one-period">What might happen after a lot of people die in one period?</h2>

<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-the-answer-to-question-number-three">What is the answer to question number three?</h2>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
- The first factor that caused the decline in birth rate is the falling rate of infant mortality due to improved sanitation and medication.
- Parents no longer need to have extra babies to compensate for child mortality.
- Economic self-interest: children are expensive and limit lifestyle quality.
- Urbanization and liberalization led to more education and rights awareness, especially among women.
- Women gained autonomy over reproductive decisions.
- Increased access to birth control, safe abortion, and family planning information in developed countries.
- Shifts in traditional gender roles and doubt about family structure contributed to lower birth rates.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-literacy-rate-and-education-rate">What is the difference between literacy rate and education rate?</h2>
