## 🌍 About This Repo  
I took **ICGS112: Geography of Human Activities** in **Trimester 3, Academic Year 2024** at MUIC.  
This repo started as a way to make **organized notes for myself** and make them **accessible for my friends** via GitHub Pages.  
It includes **lecture summaries**, **exam question notes**, and later my **assignments** in PDF and LaTeX format.

The class is **lecture-based** and generally chill. Attendance is mandatory, but the vibe is relaxing—you can do your own stuff as long as you don't disturb others.  
**Instructor:** Ms. Pattaka Sa-ngimnet — very chill, explains well, sometimes speaks Thai during lectures (usually off-topic or social commentary). If you’re an international student, don’t worry—most of the lecture is in English, and there’s no bad intent when Thai is used.
