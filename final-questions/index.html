      Explain how the concept of perceived inequality and unmet needs drives migration from rural Mexico to the United States, focusing on the socio-economic factors that push individuals to seek better opportunities abroad. Discuss in detail how remittances sent by migrants impact the long-term development of human resources, including education, skills, and healthcare, and explore their role in the expansion of the local economy through investment in infrastructure and small businesses. Evaluate how these improvements can lead to a reduction in economic and social disparities, addressing the root causes of migration. Furthermore, analyze how this shift could lead to a decrease in future migration patterns, and propose strategies for the Mexican government and local communities to foster sustainable development that reduces dependency on migration to developed countries, ensuring long-term economic stability and improved living conditions.

<h2 id="examine-the-push-and-pull-factors-behind-the-trend-of-investors-from-developed-countries-moving-their-production-to-less-developed-countries">Examine the push and pull factors behind the trend of investors from developed countries moving their production to less developed countries.</h2>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Push factors: high wages, strict environmental and labor laws, high production costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull factors: cheap labor, weak regulations, tax incentives, access to raw materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effects on host countries: job creation, economic growth, but also exploitation, pollution, cultural erosion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effects on origin countries: job losses, deindustrialization, but rise in service/tech sectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use examples like outsourcing to Southeast Asia or garment factories in Bangladesh.</p>

<li>
<p>Strengths: measurable, standardized, reflects economic output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weaknesses: ignores inequality, unpaid labor, environmental cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developed countries: high GDP may not reflect quality of life (e.g., USA).</p>
</li>
<li>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reduces population pressure and unemployment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migrants send remittances, supporting education, health, and business back home.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<ul>
